## Let me tell you a little bit about myself!

I am 21 years old and am a first year Masters student in the geology department at WVU!
I was born in a small town northwest of Philly called Allentown but I now live in Wellsboro Pennsylvania.
I did my undergraduate studies at Penn State University where I obtained a BS in Geosciences. This past
summer I interned at the Pennsylvania Geological Survey where I worked on a carbon sequestration project.
I have one older brother who in an Engineer is LA California.

#### Previous Research  
   ```bash
   * Trace Gas Laboratory
   * Brantley Group Geochemistry Lab
   ```
   
   During my time at PSU I was a research assistant in an Ice Core lab using trace gases
   to reconstruct climate in Antarctica and Greenland. I also studied stray gases
   especially methane in surface waters near areas of oil and gas development. During 
   my time here at WVU I will work with Dr. Sharma to study various environmental impacts
   from hydrocarbon extraction.
