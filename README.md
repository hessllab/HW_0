## Homework 0: I made a README.md about myself!
Here I will tell you a little bit about myself and my interests.

___Geology masters student___

#### Interests  
   1) Academic interests
      * Sedimentology
         * Evaporites
         * Fluid Inclusions in Halite 
      * Search for life on Mars
      * My research focuses on microorganisms trapped in fluid inclusions
         * Halite forms from shallow surface water brines. During times of rapid crystallization, microorganisms can become preserved within the halite itself! 
            + Here's a [link](https://www.kathleenbenison.com/red-earth-observatory-lab-group) to our lab group's web page for more information.
