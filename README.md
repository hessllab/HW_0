## My name is Zack Grzywacz

#### Background
* I come from southern Maryland
* But I went to undergrad near Baltimore at UMBC, otherwise known as the __University of Maryland, Baltimore County__
   + _Some people know UMBC for its [basketball team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_UMBC_vs._Virginia_men%27s_basketball_game)_   
* I earned a bachelor's degree in Geography & Environmental Science
    + I took an interest in forest ecology and hydrology in my undergraduate courses
    + I was president of a club that walked around forested areas of campus to pick up trash & remove invasive species

#### Current studies
I'm studying to earn my master's degree in Geography from WVU   
I'm working with Dr. Hessl (you, our professor!) on a project in Tasmania!

##### Interests + Hobbies
1) I'm into a lot of outdoor activities - such as __hiking__, __camping__, and __kayaking__.
   + I'm glad to be in Morgantown where I'm near plenty of good areas to indulge in these activities.
   + I've never been skiing but that's the next one I want to get into!
2) In undergrad I was introduced to a sport called __slacklining__.   
   + It's kind of similar to tightrope walking. You tie down a flat rope between two trees and walk across it   
   + Some people do it over large gaps at towering heights but I've never had the opportunity to do that - I'd be terrified anyway

3) In my youth I played __baseball__ and __soccer__, and in high school I was on the __track and field__ team.  
   + I'm not as athletic now but I'm getting back into fitness
4) I love to __cook__. My favorite dish to make is __chili__ because it's not incredibly difficult to make, but it uses a lot of fresh ingredients and it's delicious.
5) I watch a lot of __movies__ if I get the chance. The best movie that I've seen recently is _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_.

I'm excited to be in this class because I've used R and R studio before,
but I'm still learning how to be more efficient in my work.
